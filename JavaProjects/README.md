In this folder you'll find a variety of my Java projects from my first semester of programming (Java 1) until now (Java 3). Java 1 projects are examples of basic java code; Java 2 examples have JavaFX integration and a bit more complexity; Java 3 projects are done using Servlets, JSPs, Java Beans, and an understanding of the Model View Controller.
